              <h1>A Little About Me! </h1>
              <p> Hi! My name is Kristina. I am a Grapahic Designer and Photographer based out of Littleton, CO. I love to read, workout, drink coffee, take pictures (obviously haha), get tattoos, and be with friends when I get the chance away from responsibilities. I always say that the little things in life are what make like worth living and that translates a lot into my work in photography and graphics. I was lucky enough to find my passion for design early in high school and run with it making it into not just little passion projects, but it is slowly turning into my dream career as well.</p>
              <h1> My Story! </h1>
              <p> I found my love for design starting in high school. I was in a marketing class that was required, and we were asked to use a program called Pixlr (basically a free knock-off version of Photoshop). I remember sitting in class hating it and thinking it was the dumbest thing ever, but by the end of the semester I was teaching others how to use it and loving every second. I was determined to master it. Over the years, I have become proficient in most of the Adobe programs, designing web pages, creating and editing small videos for sports or commercials, photography, and social media management. My love for design continues to grow as I finish my degree in Digital Media and move on to bigger and better things that life has to offer me.Â </p>
              <h1> My Qualifications </h1>
              <p> In college, I started with getting my associates degree from my local community college, Illinois Central College. After finishing there, I transferred to Greenville University and get my Bachelors in Science with majoring in Digital Media and minoring in Business.</p>
              <p> I created the idea for In Design in my web design class my senior year at University, and now I get to use it as my portfolio logo and hope to grow it into a full blown business soon!</p>
